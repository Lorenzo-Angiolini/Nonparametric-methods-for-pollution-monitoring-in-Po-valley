# Nonparametric methods for pollution monitoring in Po valley
The project aims at finding insights in the distribution of pollution over different years and its relationship with weather factors.\
In the data engineering section we aggregated and selected datasets coming from different years, together with the weather information dataset. In the data exploration section we look at data in order to understand what we are dealing with, using also depth measures to understand the distribution. The other sections are used for the goals we want to achieve.
